# Blog in Gatsby

The blog of [Buildings Are Heavy](https://buildingsareheavy.com/) built in Gatsby.

I previously had built my blog in Wordpress and my personal portfolio in PHP and Bootstrap, but I felt it was best to combine both into one site. Wordpress was slow and overkill, and both PHP and Bootstrap felt limited, so a static site generator made the most sense.
